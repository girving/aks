  # Explicit Expanders via the Zig-Zag Product

  Lean 4 formalization of the Reingold–Vadhan–Wigderson (2002) zig-zag
  product and its application to constructing explicit expander families.

  General regular graph theory (`RegularGraph`, spectral gap, squaring,
  complete graph) lives in `RegularGraph.lean`. This file builds on it
  with the zig-zag product, spectral composition theorem, and the
  iterated construction that yields expanders at every size.

/-! **The Zig-Zag Product** -/

/-- **The zig-zag product** G₁ ⓩ G₂.

    Given:  G₁ = (n₁, d₁)-regular graph
            G₂ = (d₁, d₂)-regular graph  (G₂ has d₁ vertices!)
    Result: (n₁ · d₁, d₂²)-regular graph

    Vertices of G₁ ⓩ G₂ are pairs (v, k) where v ∈ V(G₁), k ∈ V(G₂) = [d₁].

    The rotation map performs three steps:
    1. **Zig**: Walk along G₂ from port k using port a (first half of d₂²).
       Arrive at port k'.
    2. **Step**: Cross the big graph G₁ along port k'.
       Arrive at (v', k'') on the other side.
    3. **Zag**: Walk along G₂ again from port k'' using port b.
       Arrive at final port k'''.

    The pair (a, b) ∈ [d₂] × [d₂] encodes the d₂²-valued port. -/

/-! **The Spectral Composition Theorem** -/

/-- **The Main Theorem (Reingold–Vadhan–Wigderson 2002):**

    λ(G₁ ⓩ G₂) ≤ λ(G₁) + λ(G₂) + λ(G₂)²

    More precisely, they prove:

    λ(G₁ ⓩ G₂) ≤ f(λ₁, λ₂)

    where f(λ₁, λ₂) < 1 whenever λ₁ < 1 and λ₂ < 1.

    The bound used in practice is:

    λ(G₁ ⓩ G₂) ≤ 1 - (1 - λ₂)² · (1 - λ₁) / 2

    Key insight: even if G₁ has terrible expansion (λ₁ close to 1),
    as long as G₂ has decent expansion (λ₂ bounded away from 1),
    the zig-zag product inherits good expansion from G₂. -/

  -- Let M₁, M₂ be the normalized adjacency matrices of G₁, G₂.
  -- Let M_zz be the normalized adjacency matrix of G₁ ⓩ G₂.
  --
  -- The zig-zag product's adjacency matrix factors as:
  --
  --   M_zz = (I_n ⊗ M₂) · P · (I_n ⊗ M₂)
  --
  -- where:
  --   I_n ⊗ M₂  = "zig/zag" step (apply G₂ within each cloud)
  --   P          = "step" (permutation matrix encoding G₁'s edges)
  --
  -- To bound λ(M_zz), we need to bound ‖M_zz x‖ for x ⊥ 𝟏.
  --
  -- Decompose x ∈ ℝ^{n·d} into n blocks of size d:
  --   x = (x₁, ..., xₙ)  where xᵢ ∈ ℝ^d
  --
  -- Further decompose each block:
  --   xᵢ = x̂ᵢ · 𝟏/√d + x̃ᵢ   where x̃ᵢ ⊥ 𝟏 in ℝ^d
  --
  -- The "hat" part x̂ = (x̂₁, ..., x̂ₙ) ∈ ℝ^n carries the
  -- inter-cloud structure. The "tilde" parts x̃ᵢ carry intra-cloud.
  --
  -- Now analyze each step:
  --
  -- Zig (I ⊗ M₂):
  --   - Leaves x̂ unchanged (M₂ · 𝟏 = 𝟏)
  --   - Contracts x̃ by factor λ₂: ‖x̃'‖ ≤ λ₂ · ‖x̃‖
  --
  -- Step (P):
  --   - Permutes blocks according to G₁'s port structure
  --   - The key: this is where G₁'s expansion acts on x̂
  --   - Contracts the "hat" component by λ₁: after projection,
  --     ‖x̂'‖_{⊥𝟏} ≤ λ₁ · ‖x̂‖_{⊥𝟏}
  --   - May inflate x̃, but only transfers hat ↔ tilde
  --
  -- Zag (I ⊗ M₂):
  --   - Again contracts tilde by λ₂
  --   - Leaves hat unchanged
  --
  -- Combining: the total operator on (x̂, x̃) satisfies
  --
  --   ‖M_zz x‖² ≤ (λ₁ · ‖x̂‖ + λ₂ · ‖x̃‖)² + (λ₂ · ‖x̂‖ + λ₂² · ‖x̃‖)²
  --
  -- Optimizing over the split ‖x̂‖² + ‖x̃‖² = 1 gives
  --
  --   λ(G₁ ⓩ G₂) ≤ 1 - (1 - λ₂)²(1 - λ₁)/2
  --
  -- This is a calculation in finite-dimensional operator norms:
  -- bound ‖A·B·C‖ via ‖A‖·‖B‖·‖C‖ on orthogonal decompositions,
  -- then optimize a quadratic form.

/-- **Corollary**: If G₂ has constant spectral gap (λ₂ < 1) and
    G₁ has any spectral gap (λ₁ < 1), the zig-zag product has
    spectral gap bounded away from 1 by a constant depending on λ₂. -/

/-! **The Base Case: A Concrete Small Expander** -/

/- To bootstrap the construction, we need one explicit small expander.

    We use the complete graph K_d on d vertices (minus self-loops,
    made into a rotation map). This has:

      λ(K_d) = 1/(d-1)

    which is < 1 for d ≥ 3.

    For the actual AKS construction, we need a specific (D⁴, D)-regular
    graph where D is a chosen constant. We can take D = 16 and
    verify the spectral gap of a 16-vertex graph computationally. -/

/-- A concrete verified base expander. For D = 8:
    H₀ is an 8-regular graph on 8⁴ = 4096 vertices with λ(H₀) ≤ 0.9.

    In a full formalization, this would be:
    1. An explicit adjacency list (or Cayley graph construction).
    2. A verified eigenvalue computation using interval arithmetic.
    The computation is large but finite and mechanically checkable. -/
axiom baseExpander : RegularGraph 4096 8

axiom baseExpander_gap : spectralGap baseExpander ≤ 9/10


/-! **The Iterated Construction** -/

/- The RVW expander family, built by iterating:

      G_{k+1} := (G_k)² ⓩ H₀

    where H₀ = baseExpander (D⁴ = 4096 vertices, D = 8 regular).

    Properties at each step (D = 8):
    • G_k is D²-regular (= 64-regular, constant degree!)
    • G_k² is D⁴-regular (= 4096-regular)
    • Zig-zag with H₀ (D⁴ vertices, D-regular) restores D²-regularity
    • n_k = D^(4(k+1)) vertices (exponential growth)
    • λ(G_k) ≤ λ_max < 1 (constant spectral gap)

    To get expanders at EVERY size n (not just n = D^(4(k+1))):
    • For arbitrary n, pick k such that n_k ≥ n.
    • Take an n-vertex subgraph or use the Friedman–Wigderson
      derandomized squaring to interpolate sizes.
    • Alternatively, the zig-zag construction can be modified to
      handle arbitrary sizes (see RVW §5).

    The key point: the degree D² is a CONSTANT independent of n,
    which is what we need for the AKS sorting network. -/

/-- **Explicit expander families exist** (via zig-zag).

  -- Take d = D² = 64 from the zig-zag construction.
  -- For each n, find k such that zigzagFamily k has ≥ n vertices,
  -- then take an induced subgraph on n vertices.
  -- (Subgraph spectral gap can only improve: fewer paths = less mixing,
  --  but formally this needs the Cauchy interlacing theorem.)

  -- Alternatively, the RVW paper shows how to handle all sizes
  -- directly via a modified iteration.

/-! **Proof Difficulty Analysis**

## Formalization Difficulty Assessment

### Category 1: Within Reach (weeks each)

- `spectralGap_nonneg`, `spectralGap_le_one`
  Eigenvalue bounds for doubly stochastic matrices.
  Mathlib has the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices.

- `spectralGap_complete`
  Explicit eigenvalue computation for the complete graph.
  The adjacency matrix of Kₙ is J - I, eigenvalues are known.

- `spectralGap_square`
  M² has eigenvalues λ². Follows from the spectral theorem.

- `zigzagFamily_gap` (given `zigzag_spectral_bound`)
  Arithmetic induction with concrete constants.

### Category 2: Substantial but Feasible (months each)

- `zigzag_spectral_bound` ← **THE CORE LEMMA**
  Operator norm bound via orthogonal decomposition.
  Needs: block matrix structure, projection operators,
  submultiplicativity of operator norms, Cauchy–Schwarz.
  All ingredients exist in Mathlib; the work is composing them.

- `expander_mixing_lemma`
  Cauchy–Schwarz on projected indicator vectors.
  Standard spectral graph theory; needs inner product spaces
  over ℝ^n which Mathlib has.

- `RegularGraph.square.rot_involution`
  `RegularGraph.zigzag.rot_involution`
  Tedious but mechanical verification from the involution property.

### Category 3: Engineering (weeks, but fiddly)

- `baseExpander` (replacing axiom with definition)
  Construct a specific Cayley graph and verify its spectral gap
  using interval arithmetic or `native_decide` on a finite matrix
  eigenvalue computation. The matrix is at most 4096 × 4096.

- `explicit_expanders_exist_zigzag` (all-sizes interpolation)
  Subgraph spectral bounds or the RVW size-interpolation trick.
  Needs Cauchy interlacing theorem.

## Comparison with Margulis/LPS Route

| Aspect                | Margulis/LPS         | Zig-Zag (RVW)           |
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Core machinery        | Property (T), Weil   | Operator norms, block LA |
| Mathlib coverage      | ~10% of needs        | ~60% of needs            |
| Deepest dependency    | Deligne's theorem    | Cauchy–Schwarz           |
| Estimated effort      | 3-5 person-years     | 6-12 person-months       |
| Spectral bound quality| Optimal (Ramanujan)  | Suboptimal but sufficient|

The zig-zag route sacrifices the Ramanujan bound λ ≤ 2√(d-1)/d
but achieves a perfectly adequate constant bound λ < 1, which is
all AKS needs. The trade-off is overwhelmingly worth it for
formalization purposes.
